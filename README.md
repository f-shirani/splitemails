The goal of doing this project is classifying spam and ham emails from Enron dataset.
The first step in doing this project is to create a dictionary of the words in this data 
and calculate the probability of occurrence of each word in spam and ham emails.
In the next step, for each e-mail, a vector should be taken along the length of the words in the dictionary
and according to the content of the e-mail this vector should be filled in and used to identify the spam or ham of an e-mail.
